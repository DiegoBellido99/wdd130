                <h1>Nazca lines</h1>
                <p>The Nazca lines and Jumana pampas geoglyphs or simply Nazca or Nasca lines are 
                    ancient geoglyphs found in the Jumana pampas, in the Nazca desert, between the
                    towns of Nazca and Palpa, in the department of Ica (Peru). They were drawn by the 
                    Nazca culture and are composed of several hundred figures that range from designs 
                    as simple as lines, to complex zoomorphic, phytomorphic and geometric figures that
                     appear drawn on the earth's surface. Since 1994, the UNESCO Committee has registered
                      the lines and geoglyphs of Nazca and Pampas de Jumana as a World Heritage Site. You
                      can visit this place by boarding a small plane to see all the figures from the sky, 
                      there are 800 figures!!!</p>
