        <h3>Why this page is better?</h3>
        <p>In other sites about tourist destinations in Peru, they only inform about the famous places
           in the country but do not provide detailed information on how to get there, nor about the sports
            that can be done, and if you want to find that information, you must search separately on other pages,
             that means that the information is very dispersed and you have to spend a lot of time searching for 
             information on those topics from page to page. Here we have gathered all that information in one 
             place so that with this page alone you have all the necessary information gathered and right here 
             you can resolve all your doubts.
